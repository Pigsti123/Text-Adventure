You walk to the window. There is a big gap in the middle where glass has been shattered. You have never quite worked out how it broke.
Text response to player input 2:
The door is made of Oak wood, but it is so old and worn that a simple touch of it and you would get splinters. It is slammed shut but not locked.
Text response to player input 3:
As you stand there staring at the door, you hear the creaking of the staircases wood under the mans heavy boots. The more you wait the closer the sounds get, 
and the more worried you become.

The room is completely empty around you. The sight of the bare room makes you think of the day you and your parents cleared your house out
to move. The rememberance of that day brings you to tears.

Text Response for(Input 1:Climb out window/attempt to climb out window):
You try to open the window and climb out, but as you do the weight of your body against the windowframe causes the glass to shatter, cutting
you in several places. In a state of shock, you scurry out onto the window ledge before freezing still at the sight of the two story drop down
to the harsh, cold looking gravel below.
